# AgentScope Utilization Re-Audit (post SPEC-018)

Status: delivered with SPEC-018 (2026-08-20)
Supersedes: the post-SPEC-017 utilization audit findings that motivated SPEC-018.
Scope: every agentscope surface the agent-platform kernel touches or deliberately does not, re-audited after the middleware alignment landed. Verified against the locked agentscope 2.0.6 install.

## 1. What SPEC-018 changed

The kernel moved off three private surfaces onto supported ones:

| Before (private surface) | After (supported surface) |
|---|---|
| `GatewayFunctionTool.check_permissions` (FunctionTool subclass) | `GatewayPermissionMiddleware.on_check_permission` |
| Per-request trace queue bound into every tool closure | `ToolEvidenceMiddleware.on_acting` + request-scoped sink contextvar |
| Per-request `_build_request_toolkit` + `agent.toolkit = ...` mutation | Per-token cached toolkit; `DELEGATED_TOKEN` contextvar read at call time; agent rebuild only on gateway-tool recovery (0 → >0) |

Adopted out-of-box features (each passed the four-point adoption gate in SPEC-018):

- `TracingMiddleware` — OTel agent/LLM/tool spans through the existing OTLP pipeline; opt-in via `AGENTSCOPE_KERNEL_TRACING`; inert without an SDK TracerProvider.
- `ReplyBudgetControlMiddleware` — weighted per-reply token budget; opt-in via `AGENTSCOPE_REPLY_TOKEN_BUDGET` (+ weights); budget state lives in `agent.state.middle_context`, covered by the SPEC-017 snapshot/restore.
- Task tools (`TaskCreate`/`TaskGet`/`TaskList`/`TaskUpdate`) — opt-in via `AGENTSCOPE_TASK_TOOLS_ENABLED`; state-local (`AgentState.tasks_context`), persisted through the SPEC-017 store, always-ALLOWed by the permission middleware, excluded from the no-tools guard.

## 2. Decision matrix — remaining agentscope surfaces

| Surface | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `Toolkit.tool_groups` internals (task-tool append, gateway-tool counting/introspection) | **Kept best-effort, pinned by tests** | The one remaining internal-facing surface after SPEC-018: tool registration lands in `tool_groups[0]` and availability is read dynamically. Works in 2.0.6 and is pinned by `test_task_tools_appended_and_excluded_from_gateway_count`; re-verify on every agentscope upgrade. |
| `MiddlewareBase` hooks (`on_check_permission`, `on_acting`, plus the out-of-box tracing/budget middlewares) | **Adopted** (SPEC-018) | Supported interception points replacing all hand-rolled paths; adoption gate passed per requirement. |
| Built-in task tools | **Adopted** (SPEC-018, opt-in) | State-local only; durability for free via SPEC-017; no infrastructure access. |
| MCP (MCPClient / MCP exposure of tool-gateway connectors) | **Spike needed** | Could let the kernel reach external MCP servers directly — must be gated so the tool-gateway stays the only execution surface (adoption gate point 1). Roadmap Exploration Backlog. |
| RAG middleware / embedding models | **Spike needed** | Semantic skill retrieval could improve recall over skills-hub's ranked lexical retrieval; must not bypass skills-hub governance/audit. Roadmap Exploration Backlog. |
| Long-term memory middlewares (Mem0 / ReME / Agentic) | **Spike needed (ReME evaluated, does not fit as-is)** | ReME evaluated 2026-08-20: file-based vault conflicts with Postgres durability and ephemeral pods; automatic LLM write-back bypasses audit and risks injecting ungrounded claims (anti-fabrication conflict); workspace-wide retrieval has no per-user isolation on a multi-operator platform. A future spike requires a governed storage backend, per-tenant scoping, and audit hooks first. |
| Kernel-side `AsyncSQLAlchemyStorage` (kernel-owned session/message storage) | **Kept platform-owned** | Sessions and agent state already persist through the platform's Postgres stores (SPEC-006/SPEC-017) under platform audit; a second storage path would fork durability and audit ownership. |
| Sandboxes / workspaces | **Kept out** | Execution surfaces contradict the read-only operational posture (adoption gate point 3). |
| Built-in file/shell tools (`Bash`/`Read`/`Write`/...) | **Kept out** | Same as sandboxes: unbounded local execution contradicts the read-only posture and tool-gateway-only execution. |
| Channels / hub (chat channels, skill hub, MCP hub) | **Kept out** | The platform owns its delivery surfaces (operator portal SSE, skills-hub, tool-gateway); adopting channels would create a second, ungoverned interaction edge. |
| TTS | **Kept out** | No operator-portal voice surface; no need identified. |
| `agentscope.app` application layer (`create_app` FastAPI factory: routers, access policy, sessions, storage, message bus, hubs, RAG, channels) | **Kept platform-owned** | Deploying it would create a second API edge with a second access model, duplicate governed capabilities (skills-hub, session durability, credential delegation), and re-instate the native-wire-protocol option rejected in ADR-0003. The `native.py` entrypoint remains a capability probe only. Its HITL projectors (`_service/_projectors`) and the AGUI protocol middleware are reference-only candidates for the HITL bridging spec. |

## 3. Entrypoint surface clarification

Only one kernel entrypoint is deployed: the `agent-service` FastAPI
application serving the platform-owned `/api/v2/` contract (ADR-0003).

- `agent-service-native` (AgentScope 2.0 service factory) — available as a
  kernel-capability probe; **not** part of the deployed topology; no
  ingress, no identity edge.
- `agent-service-runtime` (runtime adapter entrypoint) — same status:
  capability probe only.

Neither probe may gain a deployed route without its own spec passing the
adoption gate.

## 4. Future Scope carry-forward (from SPEC-018)

| Item | Status | Sequencing |
|---|---|---|
| HITL confirmation bridging (map kernel `ASK` / `RequireUserConfirmEvent` onto new v2 SSE frames; portal approve/deny; session suspend/resume) | Tracked; needs its own spec | **Must precede any write/mutating tool.** Until then the headless posture (pre-answered permission decisions, read-only tools only) is what keeps the platform safe. |
| ASK → DENY tightening (non-allow-listed gateway tools currently fall through to the interactive ASK default, which headlessly means "silently never runs") | Tracked; candidate follow-up | Behaviorally equivalent in the deployed topology; can land any time after HITL bridging design clarifies the confirmation model. |
| `agentscope.app` HITL projectors / AGUI protocol middleware as reference designs | Reference-only | Only inside the HITL bridging spec; no runtime dependency without its own adoption-gate pass. |
| Discovery negative-cache / backoff | Tracked; candidate follow-up | Empty discovery is intentionally uncached (recovery UX), but while the tool-gateway is down every turn on the `ensure_agent` fast path pays a discovery attempt (up to its timeout). A short negative-cache TTL would bound outage latency without re-poisoning recovery. |

## 5. Invariants re-confirmed

- Tool execution remains exclusive to the tool-gateway (policy, redaction, evidence, audit).
- Identity is carried only by the gateway-forwarded delegated token (now read from a contextvar at call time — token rotation safe without agent rebuilds).
- No agentscope types leak through the v2 contract; `agent-stream-event.schema.json` is byte-unchanged.
- Read-only operational posture intact; task tools perform no infrastructure access.
