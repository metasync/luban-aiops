# Provision the browser credential-set secret for the dev-k8s overlay
# (SPEC-049 R-5), and the matching application secret for the
# `acme-admin` sample app (SPEC-059 R-3).
#
# The tool-gateway's web.fill_credential and http.post tools resolve
# named credential sets from the JSON file mounted at
# GATEWAY_BROWSER_CREDENTIAL_SETS (/etc/luban/browser-credentials/
# credential-sets.json) out of the tool-gateway-browser-credentials
# secret. Values never travel through skills, prompts, or tool results.
#
# One generator, two sinks. The `acme-admin` password is generated once
# and written to BOTH consumers:
#
#   tool-gateway-browser-credentials  credential-sets.json gains an
#                                     `acme-admin` entry, which is what
#                                     web.fill_credential(credential_set=
#                                     "acme-admin") and http.post(
#                                     credential_set="acme-admin") resolve
#   acme-admin-credentials            ACME_ADMIN_PASSWORD, consumed by
#                                     the sample app's Deployment, which
#                                     seeds its `admin` user with it
#
# Deriving the second from the first (rather than generating twice) is
# the only arrangement in which the browser surface, the HTTP surface and
# the application cannot disagree about the password.
#
# Provide your own sets via BROWSER_CREDENTIAL_SETS_FILE (a JSON object
# mapping set name -> {"username": ..., "password": ...}); otherwise a
# dev set for the `acme-admin` sample app is generated with a random
# password (never echoed, never committed). The override path still
# produces the app-side secret, taken from your file's `acme-admin`
# entry — an operator supplying their own sets supplies the app's
# password too, or the app cannot start.
#
# Usage:
#   shared/platform-ops/gitops/sync-browser-credentials.sh [namespace]
#
# Override with your own file:
#   BROWSER_CREDENTIAL_SETS_FILE=./cred-sets.json \
#     shared/platform-ops/gitops/sync-browser-credentials.sh
#
# Skip in CI when secrets are injected externally:
#   SKIP_BROWSER_CREDENTIALS=true make deploy
#
# Skipping leaves BOTH secrets unwritten. The sample app then fails
# closed at startup and names this script in its log, rather than
# starting against a well-known default password.
