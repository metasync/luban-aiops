# Shared Contracts

## Purpose

`shared-contracts` contains the cross-project contracts that keep the workspace integrated without tight coupling.

Typical contents include:

- API schemas
- event schemas
- policy request and response models
- approval payloads
- audit record schemas

## Ownership

Recommended owner:

- platform architecture or core platform team

## Current Scope

This module covers:

- shared API schemas
- event and streaming payloads
- policy, approval, execution, and audit models
- versioned contracts consumed across workspace products

Current implementation artifacts:

- `schemas/chat-request.schema.json` (v1 portal/gateway contract)
- `schemas/chat-response.schema.json` (v1)
- `schemas/session.schema.json` (v1)
- `schemas/stream-event.schema.json` (v1)
- `schemas/health-response.schema.json` (v1)
- `schemas/identity-context.schema.json`
- `schemas/agent-chat-request.schema.json` (v2 platform-owned agent-service contract)
- `schemas/agent-chat-response.schema.json` (v2)
- `schemas/agent-stream-event.schema.json` (v2)
- `schemas/agent-session.schema.json` (v2)
- `schemas/agent-runtime-metadata.schema.json` (v2)
- `schemas/agent-health.schema.json` (v2)
- `schemas/identity-token.schema.json` (JWT claim set issued by identity-broker)
- `schemas/policy-rule.schema.json` (action-authorization rule, v1)
- `schemas/policy-decision.schema.json` (policy decision object, v1)
- `schemas/tool-invocation.schema.json` (tool invocation request envelope, v1)
- `schemas/tool-result.schema.json` (tool result evidence envelope, v1)
- `policies/policy-default.yaml` (default action-authorization bundle, v1)
- `observability-conventions.md` (metrics naming, OTel switch semantics, correlation bridging)

## Agent-Service Contract Conventions (v2)

The `agent-*` schemas define the platform-owned boundary between `tool-gateway` and `agent-platform` (see `ADR-0003`).

Header conventions (required on all v2 requests):

- `X-User-ID`: the authenticated or resolved user identifier; the agent-service uses this for session ownership
- `x-request-id`: correlation identifier shared across portal, gateway, and runtime for tracing

Design rules:

- identity travels in headers, never in request bodies
- response envelopes do not expose framework-specific types (no AgentScope `Msg`, `payload`, or event internals)
- the `content` field (v2) replaces the v1 `response` field for naming consistency with streaming `delta` terminology
- stream events use `type` (v2) instead of `event` (v1) to avoid collision with the SSE `event:` field name

## Identity Token Conventions

The `identity-token.schema.json` documents the JWT claim set issued by `identity-broker` and verified locally by `tool-gateway` via JWKS (RFC 7517). This schema is for documentation and contract alignment — the token is transported as a compact JWT string, not a JSON body.

Verification model:

- identity-broker signs with RSA-256 and publishes the public key at `/.well-known/jwks.json`
- the gateway fetches and caches the JWKS (no per-request network call)
- the `iss` claim is always validated against `IDENTITY_TOKEN_ISSUER`
- the `username` claim becomes the `X-User-ID` header forwarded to downstream services

## Policy Contract Conventions (v1)

The `policy-*` schemas and `policies/policy-default.yaml` define the first enforceable slice of the Tier-1 policy design (`docs/agentic-aiops-platform/policy-specification.md`), scoped to the `action_authz` domain with `allow`/`deny` outcomes only.

Action naming convention:

- `<resource>:<verb>` for resource operations (e.g. `session:create`, `session:read`)
- a bare noun for the primary conversational surface (`chat`)

Evaluation semantics (implemented by the consumer, currently `tool-gateway`):

- deny by default: no matching rule yields `deny`
- explicit `deny` overrides `allow`; higher `priority` wins between allows; disabled rules are ignored
- the decision object carries `decision`, `matched_rule_ids`, and `reason`

`policy-center` is currently a stub; when it becomes a service it will serve this same contract, so consumers swap a local evaluation call for a network call without contract changes.

## Tool Execution Contract Conventions (v1)

The `tool-invocation.schema.json` and `tool-result.schema.json` define the wire format between `agent-platform` (caller) and `tool-gateway` (executor) for tool invocations (SPEC-007).

Tool naming convention:

- `<system>.<verb>_<noun>` (e.g. `k8s.list_pods`, `k8s.get_events`)
- the system prefix identifies the external system; the verb/noun describe the operation

Result semantics:

- `status: success` — `data` contains the tool-specific payload
- `status: error` — `error` contains a machine-readable code and message
- `status: denied` — policy rejected the invocation; `error.code` is `POLICY_DENIED`
- `evidence` is always present and carries execution provenance (timestamp, duration, risk level, source system)

## Observability Conventions

Metrics naming, label/cardinality rules, the `OTEL_*` switch semantics, and the `x-request-id` ↔ `trace_id` bridging rule are defined in [observability-conventions.md](observability-conventions.md). All three Python services implement these conventions (`SPEC-005`): an always-on `/metrics` Prometheus surface plus an opt-in OTLP push pipeline gated by `OTEL_ENABLED`.

## Expected Integration Points

- all `products/` modules that publish or consume shared interfaces
- `shared/shared-sdk` for generated or hand-written client helpers
- `docs/` for documented canonical contract definitions

## Boundary

This module should remain dependency-light and should not accumulate business logic.
