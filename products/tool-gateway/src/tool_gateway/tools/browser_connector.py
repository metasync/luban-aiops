"""Browser connector: bounded web-check tool surface (SPEC-049 R-1..R-6).

Drives the pod's chromium-headless-shell sidecar over CDP through a
stateful session pool and registers a small, fixed tool surface:

  read tier   web.navigate, web.snapshot, web.screenshot,
              web.fill_credential
  write tier  web.click, web.type

Enforcement surfaces (all server-side, never model-trusted):

- Origin allowlist (R-2): navigation to an origin outside
  ``GATEWAY_BROWSER_ALLOW_ORIGINS`` is denied; redirects landing outside
  halt the page and error, and every read-tier capture re-checks the live
  origin first, so a post-load client-side redirect can't be snapshotted
  or screenshotted off-allowlist (or off the bound flow). An empty
  allowlist denies everything.
- Flow binding + deviation guard (R-4): ``web.navigate`` with a
  ``skill_id`` validates the skill's ``web_target``/``risk_class``
  declaration against skills-hub and binds the flow to the session.
  Interactions only execute inside a bound, approved, unexhausted flow —
  anything else is denied, never run silently. Write-tier interactions
  additionally ride the existing SPEC-020 confirmation bridge and SPEC-037
  signed execution upstream of the gateway, so an interaction that
  executes here is evidence of operator approval (recorded on the flow).
- Credential sets (R-5): login values resolve from a secret-mounted file
  at fill time; they never appear in results, snapshots, or logs.

Identity note: sessions key on the caller's chat session id (SPEC-049
R-1) so one stateful browser context spans a whole web-check flow —
including the owner→approver identity switch the SPEC-020/037 write path
introduces, where the resumed write-tier interaction legitimately arrives
under the approver's subject. The chat session id is a correlation handle
forwarded by trusted internal callers (the kernel and the execution
worker), never a model-supplied parameter; authority still rides the
verified bearer token. When no chat session id is present (a non-chat
caller) the connector falls back to the verified subject.
