"""Prometheus metrics surface for execution-runtime (SPEC-005 parity, SPEC-038).

Always-on, collector-independent debug surface implemented directly with
prometheus_client: a minimal RED middleware plus GET /metrics. Metric objects
live at module level so repeated create_app() calls (tests) never
double-register them in the default registry. Conventions:
shared/shared-contracts/observability-conventions.md.
