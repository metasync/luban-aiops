# The acme-admin demo suite (SPEC-059 R-8).
#
# Runs the four ladder demos in order, then the composition (SPEC-057) that
# orders two of them into one runbook, and then asserts the claim this whole
# slice makes: a mutation performed over the **HTTP** surface is visible over
# the **HTML** surface, because both really address one store. That is the
# cross-skill verification step — `LockUnlockUser` changes something, and
# `CheckUserStatus` reads it back from a page a human would look at.
#
# The ladder, and what each rung's demo asserts:
#
#   1. health-check       http.get          read    0 cards
#   2. user-status        browser flow      read    0 cards
#   3. lock-unlock-user   http.post         write   1 card, kind `action`
#   4. password-reset     browser flow      write   1 card, kind `flow`
#   5. composition        runbook (4 then 3) write  2 cards, a `flow` + an `action`
#
# Read together the four rungs make a claim none of them makes alone: the card
# count tracks the *effect* of a skill, not the surface it uses. Rungs 1 and 3
# both talk to the JSON API and differ; rungs 2 and 4 both drive a browser and
# differ. A reader who has seen all four stops inferring "browser means
# dangerous" and "API means safe". Rung 5 then composes rungs 4 and 3 into one
# runbook and makes the composition claim (SPEC-057): ordering two mutating
# skills does not merge their gates — the runbook parks two cards, one per
# sub-skill, because a composition carries no authority of its own (ADR-0011).
#
# The cross-skill leg runs deterministically, with no model involved: it makes
# the same `http.post` call `LockUnlockUser` makes, through the same gateway
# endpoint with the same `credential_set`, and then reads the rendered table
# over a real console session. With RUN_CHAT_LEG=true the two demos' chat legs
# also exercise it through the agent, and this leg additionally re-asserts the
# result after those runs.
#
# Prerequisites: see demo-lib.sh's header. `make e2e` lists this script, and its
# prerequisite echo names `make deploy-sample-app` because nothing here works
# without the app deployed.
