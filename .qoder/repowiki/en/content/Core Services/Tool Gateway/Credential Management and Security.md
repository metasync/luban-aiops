## Introduction
This document explains how the Tool Gateway manages credentials and prevents sensitive data from leaking in tool outputs through enhanced credential masking throughout the entire request/response lifecycle. It covers:
- The credential set architecture for browser login flows and HTTP service authentication with reference-based credential resolution.
- The new secrets connector providing cryptographically secure password generation with centralized policy enforcement and one-time secure delivery mechanisms.
- One-time secure delivery mechanisms including portal-based copy functionality and gated email delivery.
- The enhanced redaction system that detects and masks secrets, tokens, and personal information in tool results with comprehensive pattern matching.
- Rotation strategies, access controls, audit logging, and best practices for secure credential management.
- HTTP connector capabilities including origin allowlisting, redirect protection, and URL secret masking.
- Ephemeral masking knowledge that tracks generated credentials throughout the execution pipeline to prevent any leakage in transcripts, evidence, or audit trails.

## Project Structure
The Tool Gateway implements comprehensive credential handling and output sanitization across a focused set of modules:
- Credential sets: lazy-loaded JSON secret file with named sets for both browser login flows and HTTP Basic authentication.
- Secrets connector: CSPRNG password generation with centralized policy enforcement and one-time secure delivery mechanisms.
- Redaction engine: deterministic, code-owned pattern matching and key-based masking applied to every tool result before it leaves the gateway.
- URL redaction: specialized URL masking for query parameters and userinfo components to prevent secret leakage.
- Secret delivery buffer: ephemeral storage for one-time secret handoff with TTL expiration and owner scoping.
- HTTP connector: bounded HTTP tools with strict origin validation, redirect protection, and credential set integration.
- Browser connector: bounded web tools that consume credential sets and mask sensitive query parameters and screenshots.
- Gateway orchestration: policy checks, tool dispatch, redaction, and audit emission at a single choke point.
- Configuration: environment-driven settings controlling redaction behavior, HTTP connectivity, secrets generation, and credential set injection.

## Core Components
- **CredentialSetStore**: Loads a JSON file of named credential sets on demand, validates required fields, and reloads automatically when the file changes.
- **Secrets Connector**: Provides cryptographically secure password generation using Python's `secrets` module, enforced against a centralized password policy contract, with one-time delivery mechanisms.
- **Enhanced Redaction Engine**: Applies value-pattern matches (e.g., PEM private keys, JWTs, Bearer/Basic headers, AWS access key IDs) and explicit sensitive key names to replace values with a marker. Includes comprehensive overflow protection and fail-closed behavior.
- **URL Redaction**: Specialized URL masking for query parameters and userinfo components using a shared vocabulary of secret-bearing parameter names.
- **Secret Delivery Buffer**: Ephemeral storage for one-time secret handoff with TTL expiration, owner scoping, and atomic redemption operations.
- **HTTP Connector**: Provides bounded `http.get` and `http.post` tools with strict origin validation, redirect protection, credential set integration, and response projection with header filtering.
- **Browser Connector**: Provides bounded web.* tools. It uses credential sets for filling credentials and masks secret-bearing URL query parameters and screenshot content to prevent leaks.
- **GatewayService.invoke_tool**: Orchestrates identity resolution, policy enforcement, tool dispatch, redaction, and audit logging. Redaction is applied once, at the gateway boundary, before both response and audit trail.
- **GatewaySettings**: Environment-driven configuration for redaction toggles, overflow thresholds, HTTP connectivity, secrets generation, and credential set paths.

## Architecture Overview
The Tool Gateway enforces a strict execution pipeline with multiple security layers and enhanced credential masking throughout the request/response lifecycle:
- Identity and policy are resolved first.
- Tools are invoked through a registry; HTTP, browser, and secrets tools may use credential sets or policy enforcement.
- All tool results pass through comprehensive redaction before being returned or logged.
- Generated credentials are tracked with ephemeral masking knowledge to prevent leakage in any projection.
- Audit events record decisions and outcomes without leaking secrets.

## Detailed Component Analysis

### Credential Set Architecture
- Named sets: Each entry maps a human-friendly name to a dictionary containing at least username and password strings.
- Lazy loading: The store reads the file only when needed and caches until mtime changes.
- Validation: Only entries with non-empty username and password are accepted; malformed entries are ignored with warnings.
- Rotation: Because the store reloads on file modification, operators can rotate credentials by updating the mounted secret file without restarting the gateway.
- Safety: Names are safe to expose; values never appear in logs or results and flow only into authentication mechanisms.

### Reference-Based Credential Injection into Tool Invocations

**Updated** Added support for HTTP connector with reference-based credential sets and proper secret handling.

#### HTTP Connector Credential Resolution
- **Reference-only approach**: HTTP tools accept `credential_set` parameter (name only), never literal secrets.
- **Basic Authentication**: Credential sets resolve to HTTP Basic auth headers server-side.
- **Origin validation**: Requests must target allowlisted origins; loopback, link-local, and multicast addresses are always refused.
- **Redirect protection**: POST requests never follow redirects; GET requests validate each hop against the allowlist.
- **Secret query parameter handling**: POST URLs cannot carry secret-bearing query parameters; GET URLs mask them in responses.

#### Browser Connector Integration
- **Fill credentials**: Browser connector holds a CredentialSetStore instance and resolves named sets at fill time.
- **Parameter binding**: The web.fill_credential tool consumes a named set and injects username/password into the page via Playwright. Values are not serialized into results, snapshots, or evidence.
- **Screenshot protection**: When capturing screenshots, the connector masks filled password values in the DOM before capture to avoid leaking them in images.
- **Query parameter masking**: URLs reported in evidence have secret-bearing query parameters masked so they do not leak into results or audit trails.

### Generated Password Policy Enforcement

**New** Added comprehensive password generation with centralized policy enforcement.

#### CSPRNG Password Generation
- **Cryptographic randomness**: Uses Python's `secrets` module for cryptographically secure random generation, never model-invented randomness.
- **Policy-driven strength**: Enforced against a centralized `password-policy` contract that defines minimum length, required character classes, and entropy floors.
- **Hybrid policy model**: Versioned contract serves as source of truth while allowing per-deployment tightening via environment variables.
- **Validation safeguards**: Requests below policy floor are refused or raised to minimum; impossible requests fail closed with `INVALID_PARAMETERS`.

#### Password Policy Contract
- **Default policy**: Minimum 16 characters (floor 12), all four character classes required (uppercase, lowercase, digit, non-alphabetic), 64-bit entropy floor.
- **Configurable options**: Optional `exclude_ambiguous` flag for removing confusing characters like I/l/1/O/0.
- **Drift prevention**: `validate-password-policy` verify leg ensures tool implementation matches contract specifications.
- **Named policies**: Framework supports future named policies (default, strict) as additive extensions.

### One-Time Secure Delivery Mechanisms

**New** Added secure delivery mechanisms for generated passwords without plaintext exposure.

#### Portal Copy Handoff (Primary Channel)
- **Redemption-on-click**: Generated values are stored in ephemeral, single-use, TTL-bounded buffers and accessed via authenticated redemption endpoints.
- **No plaintext projection**: The actual password never enters transcripts, titles, cards, or evidence frames - only opaque delivery IDs are exposed.
- **Owner-scoped access**: Delivery handles are scoped to session owners and cannot be redeemed by other identities.
- **Single-use redemption**: Each delivery handle can only be used once, then becomes invalid.

#### Email Delivery Channel (Optional, Gated)
- **Write-tier action**: Requires `secrets:deliver` policy action plus `tools:mutate` permission.
- **Recipient allowlisting**: Configurable allowlist (`GATEWAY_EMAIL_RECIPIENT_ALLOWLIST`) with optional strict mode.
- **Mandatory approval**: Parks an action card requiring explicit approval, with prominent warnings for out-of-allowlist recipients.
- **TLS encryption**: Emails sent over TLS with no logging of secret content.

#### Delivery Buffer Architecture
- **Pluggable backends**: In-memory backend for single-replica deployments, Redis backend for multi-replica setups.
- **TTL management**: Handles expire automatically after configurable time-to-live.
- **Atomic operations**: Single-use redemption via atomic GETDEL operations in Redis backend.
- **Replica-safe design**: Mirrors existing session store patterns for consistency.

### Enhanced Output Redaction System
- **Value patterns**: Detects and replaces high-confidence secret shapes such as PEM private keys, JWTs, Bearer/Basic authorization values, and AWS-style access key IDs.
- **Explicit key list**: Replaces string values under known sensitive field names (password, token, secret, api_key, etc.).
- **Overflow control**: If more than a configured fraction of the payload would be redacted, the gateway returns an error instead of leaking partial secrets.
- **Single choke point**: Redaction runs once after tool execution and before any response or audit log serialization.
- **Generated value masking**: Generated passwords are added to the secret vocabulary and masked in all projections including evidence, transcripts, titles, and cards.
- **Ephemeral masking knowledge**: Tracks generated credentials throughout the execution pipeline to ensure complete masking in all output surfaces.

### URL Secret Query Redaction
**New** Dedicated URL masking for query parameters and userinfo components.

- **Shared vocabulary**: Uses a centralized list of secret-bearing parameter names (password, token, api_key, etc.) matched case-insensitively.
- **Userinfo masking**: Masks passwords in `scheme://user:password@host` format.
- **Query parameter masking**: Replaces values of secret-bearing parameters with `***` while preserving parameter names.
- **Preservation**: Non-secret bytes are preserved exactly without re-encoding.
- **Cross-connector usage**: Both HTTP and browser connectors import this module for consistent URL masking.

### Access Controls and Risk Tiers
- Policy enforcement: Every invocation is evaluated against the policy bundle; mutating tools additionally require a mutate permission.
- Risk tiers: Tools declare read/write/admin risk levels; write/admin tools cannot be auto-approved and require explicit authorization.
- Browser-specific guards: Origin allowlists, flow binding, step budgets, and deviation guards ensure interactions stay within approved targets.
- HTTP-specific guards: Origin allowlists, redirect protection, and body size limits ensure safe HTTP operations.
- Secrets-specific controls: Password generation is read-tier with no confirmation; email delivery requires `secrets:deliver` action plus HITL approval.

### Audit Logging and Correlation
- Request correlation: A stable request ID is resolved from headers, tracing, or generated UUIDs to correlate events across services.
- Audit events: Both policy decisions and tool invocations are emitted with subject, roles, tool name, status, duration, risk level, and redaction span counts—without secrets.
- Evidence integrity: Tool results are redacted before audit emission to prevent leakage in durable logs.
- New audit types: `secret_delivered` event type tracks delivery channel and recipient without exposing secret values.

## Dependency Analysis
- Configuration drives behavior:
  - Redaction enabled/disabled and overflow threshold.
  - HTTP connector feature flags, origin allowlist, timeout, and credential set path.
  - Browser feature flags, origin allowlist, session limits, and credential set path.
  - Secrets connector enablement, password policy contract path, delivery buffer backend, and email configuration.
- CredentialSetStore depends on filesystem availability and JSON validity; it degrades gracefully when unreadable.
- HTTPConnector depends on origin validation, credential set resolution, and URL redaction.
- BrowserConnector depends on the skills service for flow validation, Playwright for browser automation, and URL redaction.
- SecretsConnector depends on password policy contract, delivery buffer backend, and email SMTP configuration.
- GatewayService depends on policy engine, token verifier, and audit emitter; it centralizes redaction and audit emission.

## Performance Considerations
- Redaction cost: Pattern scanning and recursive traversal run once per tool result; keep payloads reasonable and tune overflow thresholds to avoid excessive masking.
- URL redaction cost: URL parsing and query parameter processing occur for every HTTP request and browser navigation; minimal overhead due to efficient string operations.
- Credential set reload: File stat and JSON parse occur only on mtime change; frequent rotations are supported without restarts.
- HTTP connection pooling: HTTP client instances are created per request but benefit from underlying connection reuse.
- Browser concurrency: Each chat session serializes interactions to avoid race conditions on shared page state.
- Password generation cost: CSPRNG generation is computationally lightweight; policy validation adds minimal overhead.
- Delivery buffer operations: Single-use redemption involves database lookups and atomic operations; designed for low-latency access.
- Ephemeral masking overhead: Tracking generated credentials adds minimal overhead during tool execution but provides comprehensive protection across all output surfaces.

## Troubleshooting Guide
Common issues and diagnostics:
- **Credential sets file unreadable**:
  - Symptom: Warnings about unreadable files; last good load retained.
  - Action: Verify file path, permissions, and JSON structure; ensure each set has non-empty username and password.
- **Redaction overflow**:
  - Symptom: Tool invocation returns an error indicating too much of the result was redacted.
  - Action: Tighten parameters to reduce secret exposure; review tool logic to avoid returning large secret blobs.
- **HTTP origin not allowed**:
  - Symptom: HTTP requests denied due to off-allowlist origin.
  - Action: Add the target origin to `GATEWAY_HTTP_ALLOW_ORIGINS`; verify hostname normalization.
- **HTTP redirect not allowed**:
  - Symptom: POST requests refuse to follow redirects; GET requests halt on off-allowlist redirects.
  - Action: Ensure upstream services don't redirect unexpectedly; configure appropriate redirect handling.
- **Secret query parameters in HTTP URLs**:
  - Symptom: POST requests rejected with secret-bearing query parameters; GET requests mask them in responses.
  - Action: Move secrets to request bodies for POST; rely on automatic masking for GET responses.
- **Unknown credential set**:
  - Symptom: HTTP requests fail with `CREDENTIAL_SET_NOT_FOUND`.
  - Action: Verify credential set name exists in the configured file; check file path configuration.
- **Browser origin not allowed**:
  - Symptom: Navigation or interaction denied due to off-allowlist origin.
  - Action: Add the target origin to the allowlist; ensure flow binding matches the intended target.
- **Secret-bearing query parameters in browser evidence**:
  - Symptom: URLs in results/evidence contain sensitive query values.
  - Action: Ensure the connector's URL masking is active; verify that reported URLs go through the masking function.
- **Password generation policy violations**:
  - Symptom: Password generation fails with policy-related errors.
  - Action: Check password policy contract configuration; verify requested length meets minimum requirements; review character class constraints.
- **Delivery buffer exhaustion**:
  - Symptom: Delivery handles become invalid or expired.
  - Action: Check TTL configuration; verify buffer backend connectivity; ensure handles are redeemed promptly.
- **Email delivery failures**:
  - Symptom: Email delivery fails with SMTP or recipient errors.
  - Action: Verify SMTP configuration; check recipient allowlist settings; confirm `secrets:deliver` policy action is granted.
- **Secrets connector not available**:
  - Symptom: `secrets.generate_password` tool not found in discovery.
  - Action: Enable `GATEWAY_SECRETS_ENABLED=true`; verify password policy contract is accessible.
- **Password policy contract errors**:
  - Symptom: Password generation fails with policy loading errors.
  - Action: Check `GATEWAY_PASSWORD_POLICY_PATH`; verify YAML syntax and policy structure; ensure contract version is compatible.
- **Email recipient not allowed**:
  - Symptom: Email delivery blocked with `EMAIL_RECIPIENT_NOT_ALLOWED`.
  - Action: Add recipient domain to `GATEWAY_EMAIL_RECIPIENT_ALLOWLIST`; adjust strict allowlist settings.
- **Ephemeral masking issues**:
  - Symptom: Generated credentials appearing in unexpected output surfaces.
  - Action: Verify redaction is enabled and configured correctly; check that all output paths go through the redaction layer; review overflow thresholds.

## Conclusion
The Tool Gateway centralizes credential management and output sanitization to minimize risk through enhanced credential masking throughout the entire request/response lifecycle:
- Credentials are stored as named sets in a secret-mounted file and injected safely into both browser sessions and HTTP Basic authentication.
- Reference-based credential resolution ensures secrets never appear as literals in tool parameters or logs.
- Generated passwords provide cryptographically secure alternatives to manual password creation, enforced against centralized policy contracts.
- One-time secure delivery mechanisms prevent plaintext exposure through redemption-on-click and gated email channels.
- Enhanced redaction applies deterministic pattern and key-based masking to all tool outputs, with fail-closed overflow protection and comprehensive coverage.
- URL redaction provides specialized masking for query parameters and userinfo components across all connectors.
- Ephemeral masking knowledge tracks generated credentials throughout the execution pipeline to prevent any leakage in transcripts, evidence, or audit trails.
- HTTP connector adds robust origin validation, redirect protection, and response projection with header filtering.
- Policy enforcement, risk-tier gating, and audit logging provide strong access controls and traceability without leaking secrets.

### Example: Defining Custom Credential Sets
- Create a JSON file with named sets, each containing username and password strings.
- Mount the file into the gateway container and configure the credential sets path via environment.
- Reference the set name in `web.fill_credential` or HTTP tool parameters; values are injected into the respective systems but never logged or returned.
- HTTP connector supports both browser and HTTP credential sets through shared configuration.

### Example: Configuring HTTP Connector
- Enable HTTP connector via `GATEWAY_HTTP_ENABLED=true`.
- Configure allowed origins via `GATEWAY_HTTP_ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://service:8080,http://api:9090`.
- Set timeouts and size limits via `GATEWAY_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS`, `GATEWAY_HTTP_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`, `GATEWAY_HTTP_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`.
- Configure credential sets via `GATEWAY_HTTP_CREDENTIAL_SETS` or fall back to browser credential sets.

### Best Practices for Managing External System Credentials
- Store credentials in secret-mounted files; never inline values in configuration or code.
- Rotate credentials by updating the mounted file; no restart required.
- Limit HTTP origins to trusted targets and configure appropriate allowlists.
- Use reference-based credentials exclusively; never pass literal secrets in tool parameters.
- Rely on policy and risk tiers to restrict mutating actions.
- Monitor audit logs for policy decisions and tool invocations; investigate denials and redaction overflows promptly.
- Configure appropriate timeouts and size limits to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Test credential rotation procedures regularly to ensure seamless updates.
- Use generated passwords for temporary access scenarios; enforce centralized policy compliance.
- Implement proper delivery mechanisms to prevent plaintext exposure of generated secrets.
- Regularly review and update password policies to meet evolving security requirements.
- Configure email delivery channels with appropriate recipient allowlists and strict modes.
- Monitor delivery buffer capacity and TTL settings for optimal performance.
- Leverage ephemeral masking knowledge to ensure comprehensive credential protection across all output surfaces.
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting for credential-related security events.
